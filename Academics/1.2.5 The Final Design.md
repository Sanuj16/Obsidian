# 1.2.5 The Final Design

The final design of our learning system can be naturally described by four distinct programs modules that represent the central components in many learning systems. The four modules are as follows:
- The **Performance System** is the module that must solve the given performance task, in this case playing checkers, by using the learned target function(s). It takes an instance of a new problem (new game) as input and produces a trace of its solution (game history) as output. In our case, the strategy used by the Performance System to select its next move at each step is determined by the learned $\hat{V}$ evaluation function. Therefore, we expect its performance to improve as this evaluation function becomes increasingly accurate.
- The **Critic** takes as input the history or trace of the game and produces as output a set of training examples of the target function. As shown in the diagram, each training example in this case corresponds to some game state in the trace, along with an estimate $V_{train}$, of the target function value for this example. In our example, the Critic corresponds to the training rule given by [[1.2.4 Choosing a Function Approximation Algorithm#^7c7859|Equation (1.1).]]
- The **Generalizer** takes as input the training examples and produces an output hypothesis that is its estimate of the target function. It generalizes from the specific training examples, hypothesizing a general function that covers these examples and other cases beyond the training examples. In our example, the Generalizer corresponds to the LMS algorithm, and the output hypothesis is the function $\hat{V}$ described by the learned weights $\omega_{0}, . . . , \omega_6$.
- The **Experiment Generator** takes as input the current hypothesis (currently learned function) and outputs a new problem (i.e., initial board state) for the Performance System to explore. Its role is to pick new practice problems that will maximize the learning rate of the overall system. In our example, the Experiment Generator follows a very simple strategy: It always proposes the same initial game board to begin a new game. More sophisticated strategies could involve creating board positions designed to explore particular regions of the state space.
