# 1.5.2 Fault Tolerance and System Availability
In addition to performance, system availability and application flexibility are two other important design goals in a distributed computing system.

## 1.5.2.1 System Availability
HA (high availability) is desired in all clusters, grids, P2P networks, and cloud systems. A system is highly available if it has a long mean time to failure (MTTF) and a short mean time to repair (MTTR). System availability is formally defined as follows: System $Availability = MTTF/(MTTF + MTTR)$

Any failure that will pull down the operation of the entire system is called a *single point of failure*. The rule of thumb is to design a dependable computing system with no single point of failure.
In general, as a distributed system increases in size, availability decreases due to a higher chance of failure and a difficulty in isolating the failures.

SMP and MPP $\to$ Very vulnerable due to single OS.
NUMA machines have improved due to use of multiple OSes.
Clusters are designed to have HA with failover capability.
Grids have higher availability due to the isolation of faults.
Therefore, clusters, clouds, and grids have decreasing availability as the system increases in size.
A P2P file-sharing network has the highest aggregation of client machines. However, it operates independently with low availability, and even many peer nodes depart or fail simultaneously.
