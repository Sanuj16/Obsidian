A probability space has three components:
1. a sample space $\Omega$, which is the set of all possible outcomes of the random process modeled by the probability space;
2. a family of sets $F$ representing the allowable events, where each set in $F$ is a subset
of the sample space $\Omega$ and
3. a probability function $Pr: F â†’ R$ satisfying [[Definition 1.2]].
An element of is called a simple or elementary event.
In the randomized algorithm for verifying polynomial identities, the sample space is the set of integers $[1, . . . , 100d]$. Each choice of an integer $r$ in this range is a simple event.
