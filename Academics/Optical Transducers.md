## Internal Reflectance Spectroscopy(IRS)
These methods are concerned with studying material adsorbed on an optical surface. Particularly suitable for use with immunoassays
Three principal variations are
1. ATR attenuated total reflectance
2. TIRF total internal reflection fluorescence
3. SPR surface plasmon resonance

## Attenuated Total reflectance

With a light wave striking the interface between two media of
refractive indices n1 and n2 total internal reflection occurs
when the angle of reflection is such that

If θ θ c there is an evanescent wave refracted through the interface in the
Z direction which penetrates the n 2 medium a distance dp which is of the
order of a wavelength
