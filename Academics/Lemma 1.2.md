For any finite or countably infinite sequence of events $E1, E2, . . . ,$

$Pr(\bigcup\limits_{i\ge1}E_i)\le\sum\limits_{i\ge1}Pr(E_i)$ 

Notice that Lemma 1.2 differs from the third part of [[Definition 1.2]] in that Definition 1.2 is an equality and requires the events to be pairwise mutually disjoint. [[Lemma 1.1]] can be generalized to [[Lemma 1.3]], often referred to as the *inclusionâ€“exclusion principle*.
