# Well-Posed Learning Problems

*Definition* : A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.

A checkers learning problem:
- Task $T$: playing checkers
- Performance measure $P$: percent of games won against opponents
- Training experience $E$: playing practice games against itself

A handwriting recognition learning problem:
- Task $T$: recognizing and classifying handwritten words within images
- Performance measure $P$: percent of words correctly classified
- Training experience $E$: a database of handwritten words with given classifications

A robot driving learning problem:
-  Task $T$: driving on public four-lane highways using vision sensors
-  Performance measure $P$: average distance traveled before an error (as judged by human overseer)
-  Training experience $E$: a sequence of images and steering commands recorded while observing a human driver

Our concern here is not to analyze the meaning of the English word "learning" as it is used in everyday language. Instead, our goal is to define precisely a class of problems that encompasses interesting forms of learning, to explore algorithms that solve such problems, and to understand the fundamental structure of learning problems and processes.
